<h2>Loan Eligibility Prediction System</h2>

🧾Summary:-

Predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for approval based on personal, financial, and credit-related features using machine learning.

🔍 Overview

Loan approval is a critical process in banking that requires accurate risk assessment.✅
This project builds a machine learning classification model that predicts loan eligibility using historical applicant data.✅


❓ Problem Statement

Banks manually evaluate loan applications, which is:

✅Time-consuming

✅Error-prone

✅Subjective

👉 Objective:-
Predict whether a loan should be Approved or Rejected based on applicant attributes.

📊 Dataset:-<a href="https://github.com/rajankumar-1439/loan-eligibility-prediction-ml/blob/main/Loan%20eligibility%20dataset.csv">Loan Prediction Dataset</a>

Features include:

✅Gender

✅Marital Status

✅Education

✅Self Employed

✅Applicant Income

✅Co-applicant Income

✅Loan Amount

✅Loan Amount Term

✅Credit History

✅Property Area

👉Target Variable:

✅Loan_Status

Y → Loan Approved

N → Loan Rejected


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

✅Python, ✅Pandas, ✅NumPy, ✅Matplotlib / Seaborn, ✅Scikit-learn, ✅Jupyter Notebook


⚙️ Methodology
Step-by-Step ML Workflow:

1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

2️⃣ Handling Missing Values

3️⃣ Encoding Categorical Features

4️⃣ Feature Selection

5️⃣ Train-Test Split

6️⃣ Model Training (Classification Model)

7️⃣ Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score

👉 Standard ML pipeline — clean and correct.

🧠 Key Insights

✅Credit History is the most influential feature

✅Applicant Income alone does not guarantee approval

✅Combining financial + demographic data improves prediction


📊 Model / Output

✅Model predicts Loan Approved (Y) or Rejected (N)

✅Output based on learned historical patterns

✅Performance evaluated using Accuracy Score


▶️ How to Run This Project
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rajankumar-1439/loan-eligibility-prediction-ml

# Step 2: Navigate to project directory
cd loan-eligibility-prediction-ml

# Step 3: Install required libraries
pip install -Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

# Step 4: Open the notebook

👉 Results & Conclusion

✅Successfully built a loan eligibility prediction model

✅Model learns meaningful approval patterns

✅Suitable for learning ML fundamentals and portfolio demonstration

✅This is not production-ready — and pretending it is would be dishonest.

🚀 Future Work

✅Add Precision, Recall, F1-Score

✅Try multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

✅Build a Streamlit Web App

✅Perform Hyperparameter Tuning

✅Handle class imbalance properly
